# Twitter Clone (Interactive Feed)

A simple Twitter-style feed built with **vanilla JavaScript**, HTML, and CSS.  
Users can like tweets, retweet them, reply, and post new tweets — all handled dynamically with JavaScript.

This project was built as part of the **Scrimba Frontend Path** to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with data structures.
